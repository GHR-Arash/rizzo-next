# Rizzo Next
Rizzo next is the evolution of Lonely Planet's pattern library. 

The idea of a pattern library such as rizzo is to have common grounds between design and development. Pull out patterns
from the design and implement them in a re-usable fashion across projects.

This repository contains common styles, and components as well as performance data, and unit tests.
